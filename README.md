# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Installing the dependency libraries

First, you will need to install all the dependency libraries for this project.

To install dependencies, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn
```

## Step 2: Run your Application

I have used Android device for development and testing of the app, so I recommend you to run the application in android device or emulator only.

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-android

```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or android device shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
